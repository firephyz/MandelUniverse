# Mandelverse
Just a fun project of mine to implement a mandelbrot viewer not in my normal C, but java this time.

Java seems to be very slow at rendering even just one frame. Thus, instead of making it interactive, 
the program instead generates hundreds of pictures of the mandelbrot set as it zooms in. Only when it has
finished does it display the images on the screen giving the audience a nice video to watch.
